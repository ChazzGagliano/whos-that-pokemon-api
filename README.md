# Who's That Pokémon? – Full-Stack Game

A full-stack web app inspired by the classic “Who’s That Pokémon?” intermission from the 90s Pokémon series.  
Users try to correctly type the name of the Pokémon shown on screen across multiple difficulty modes and regions.

## Goal of the Project

I built this project to deepen my experience with the MERN stack, especially:
- Using **MongoDB** for user data and saved Pokémon
- Building a custom **Node/Express API** on top of an external API
- Getting more elaborate with **React UI and styling**

## Features

- User authentication (create account / log in)
- Multiple difficulty modes (Easy/Hard for Kanto, Hard for Johto)
- Search and explore Pokémon by name
- Save favorite Pokémon to a personal profile
- Stores user data and progress in MongoDB

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **External API:** [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- **Other:** CSS, HTML

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install

# Start the frotnend and backend/server
