# whos-that-pokemon-api
Welcome to the Who's That Pokémon API! This project is a fun game inspired by the intermission "Who's That Pokémon?" from the 90s Pokémon series. Users are challenged to correctly type out the name of the Pokémon displayed on the screen. There are different difficulty levels to choose from:

Goal of Project: 
I wanted to continue challenging myself with MongoDB and making unique features for the User. I also wanted to go more in depth with frontend. Mainly, getting more elaborate with styling.

External API: https://pokeapi.co/

Technologies Used:

-MongoDB: For database management

-Express.js: For building the backend API

-React: For building the frontend interface

-Node.js: For running the server

-PokeAPI: For retrieving Pokémon data (https://pokeapi.co/)

Future Plans:

- Using MongoDB, allow users to create and log into their accounts(complete)
  
- Allow users to save data from the api into their profile(complete)

- Allow users to explore pokemon with search feature(complete)
